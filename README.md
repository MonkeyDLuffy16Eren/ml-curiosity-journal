# ml-curiosity-journal
✨ A personal journal of small research insights, thought experiments, and moments of curiosity I encounter while learning Machine Learning. Not always perfect, not always polished — just honest exploration and deep thinking beyond the surface.

Why this journal?
I have a strong desire to engage in meaningful research and professional collaboration within the Machine Learning community. This journal is my stepping stone — a way to document my evolving understanding, experiment with ideas, and share my thought process transparently.

I believe that true learning happens through exploration, questioning, and dialogue. This repo is open for discussion, collaboration, and constructive feedback from fellow researchers and enthusiasts.

What you’ll find here
Research notes and insights on ML concepts

Thought experiments and brainstorming sessions

Explorations of new papers, algorithms, and techniques

Honest reflections on challenges and discoveries

Links and summaries of interesting resources

Collaboration and Contribution
I’m still a learner on my Machine Learning journey, but I’m really eager to seek guidance and collaborate with faculty members and experienced researchers. I deeply value learning from those with expertise and welcome any opportunities for contributions, suggestions, or joint work.

Whether it’s sharing feedback on ideas, experimenting together, or co-authoring research, I’m excited to connect and learn alongside passionate professionals. Let’s explore and grow together on this path of discovery!


Thank you for visiting! Let’s explore the fascinating world of Machine Learning, one curiosity at a time.
